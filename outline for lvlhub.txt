Phase 2: Building Core Modules (FastAPI Backend)
Objective: Develop the core backend modules using FastAPI, defining data models, schemas, API routers, and the workflow engine.
STEP-4: Define Data Models and Database Configuration (SQLAlchemy)
Task: Define SQLAlchemy models and configure the database connection.
Refined Prompt (to Blackboxai ROBOCODER AI):
"Now, we'll define the SQLAlchemy models and configure the database.
Database Configuration (database.py):
Generate code for database.py that:
1. Imports necessary SQLAlchemy components: create_engine, sessionmaker, declarative_base.

2. Defines a database URL. For now, use SQLite for development: DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./steps_marketing.db"

3. Creates a SQLAlchemy engine: engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL, connect_args={"check_same_thread": False})

4. Creates a SessionLocal class using sessionmaker: SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)

5. Defines a Base using declarative_base(): Base = declarative_base()

6. Add a function to create all tables in the database:

7. Python
def create_all_tables():
    Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
   8.    9.    10. Add a function to get a database session.

   11. Python
def get_db():
    db = SessionLocal()
    try:
        yield db
    finally:
        db.close()
      12.       13. SQLAlchemy Models (models/*.py):
Generate the Python code for the following files within the models/ directory, defining the models with their fields and relationships as specified below:
      * models/user.py
      * models/onboarding.py
      * models/lead.py
      * models/campaign.py
      * models/offer.py
      * models/message.py
      * models/funnel.py

      * models/element.py
      * models/automation.py
      * models/trigger.py
      * models/action.py
      * models/workflow.py

STEP-6: Create API Routers (with Database Integration)
Task: Create FastAPI routers for each resource, integrating with the database.
Refined Prompt (to Blackboxai ROBOCODER AI):
"Create API routers for each resource, defining endpoints for CRUD operations. Now, integrate with the actual database using SQLAlchemy and the get_db dependency from database.py.
Create the following files within the routers/ directory:

Router Specifications:
For each router:
      1. Import necessary modules: FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException, the relevant SQLAlchemy model, Pydantic schemas, and the get_db dependency.
      2. Create a router instance: router = APIRouter(prefix="/resource_name", tags=["resource_name"]) (replace resource_name).
      3. Define CRUD endpoints:
      * GET / (get all, with optional pagination, filtering, and sorting)
      * GET /{item_id} (get one by ID)
      * POST / (create)
      * PUT /{item_id} (update)
      * DELETE /{item_id} (delete)
      4. Use the db: Session = Depends(get_db) dependency in each endpoint to get a database session.
      5. Use SQLAlchemy queries to interact with the database (e.g., db.query(Model).all(), db.query(Model).filter(Model.id == item_id).first(), db.add(new_item), db.commit(), db.refresh(new_item), db.delete(item), etc.).
      6. Handle potential errors (e.g., item not found) by raising HTTPException.

STEP-7: Implement Workflow Engine
Task: Build the core workflow engine to automate tasks based on triggers and conditions.
Refined Prompt (to Blackboxai ROBOCODER AI):
"Now, let's create the workflow engine. This system will allow users to define automated sequences of actions based on specific triggers and conditions.
1. Create workflows/models.py:
(Same as in the previous responses)
2. Create workflows/schemas.py:
(Same as in the previous responses)
3. Create workflows/engine.py:
Implement the core workflow logic, including comprehensive trigger handling, action execution, scheduling, robust error handling, detailed logging, conditional branching, optimization suggestions, A/B testing logic and workflow prioritization.

6. Workflow Versioning (Conceptual):
      * Database Changes:
      * Add a version column (integer) to the Workflow model.
      * Add a parent_workflow_id column (nullable integer, foreign key referencing Workflow.id) to the Workflow model to link versions.
      * API Changes:
      * Modify the workflow creation endpoint to accept an optional parent_workflow_id. If provided, increment the version number from the parent.
      * Add endpoints to retrieve specific versions of a workflow and to "roll back" to a previous version (by creating a new version based on the old one).
      * Workflow Engine Changes:
      * Ensure the workflow engine always uses the latest active version of a workflow.
      * Consider adding a mechanism to "pause" or "deactivate" all running instances of a workflow when a new version is created.
7. Unit and Integration Tests (Conceptual):
      * Create a tests/ directory in the project's root.
      * Unit Tests:
      * Create test files within tests/ corresponding to the modules you want to test (e.g., tests/test_workflows.py, tests/test_services.py, tests/test_utils.py).
      * Use a testing framework like pytest to write unit tests for individual functions and classes.
      * Focus on testing:
      * Data validation and transformation logic.
      * Core workflow engine functions (trigger handling, action execution, scheduling).
      * Service functions (e.g., create_lead, update_lead, send_email).
      * Mock external dependencies (e.g., database, API calls) to isolate units of code.
      * Integration Tests:
      * Create test files within tests/ to test interactions between different parts of the system.
      * Focus on testing:
      * API endpoints (using FastAPI's TestClient).
      * End-to-end workflow execution, including triggers, actions, and database interactions.
      * Interactions with external services (if applicable).
8. Workflow Scheduling, Queuing, and Prioritization:
      * Scheduling:
      * The engine.py module already uses APScheduler for scheduling triggers.
      * Ensure that the scheduler is configured with an appropriate thread pool size to handle concurrent workflow executions.
      * Queuing:
      * For high-volume scenarios, consider using a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Redis Queue, Cel
      * Queuing:
      * For high-volume scenarios, consider using a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Redis Queue, Celery) to manage workflow executions.
      * When a trigger fires, instead of executing the workflow directly, add a task to the queue. The task should include relevant information, such as the trigger ID and any necessary data (e.g., lead ID for a data-based trigger).
      * Have worker processes consume tasks from the queue and execute them.
      * This will prevent the system from being overwhelmed by a large number of concurrent executions.
      * Prioritization:
      * Add a priority field (integer) to the Workflow model. Higher numbers indicate higher priority.
      * When adding tasks to the queue, use the workflow's priority to determine the task's priority in the queue.
      * Configure the worker processes to prioritize tasks with higher priority values.
      * Alternatively, consider using separate queues for different priority levels.
      * Allow users to set the priority of a workflow when they create or edit it. Provide guidelines for assigning priorities (e.g., time-sensitive campaigns might have higher priority than onboarding sequences).
9. Workflow Error Handling:
      * Retry Mechanisms:
      * Implement retry mechanisms for actions that might fail due to transient errors (e.g., network issues, temporary API outages).
      * Use exponential backoff with jitter to avoid overwhelming external services.
      * Define a maximum number of retries for each action.
      * Error Handling Logic:
      * In engine.py, within the execute_action function, add more specific error handling logic for each action type.
      * For example, if an email fails to send, you might want to:
      * Log the error with details (recipient, subject, error message).
      * Update the ActionExecution status to "failed".
      * Optionally send a notification to the user or administrator.
      * If a workflow execution fails, update the WorkflowExecution status to "failed" and store the error details.
      * Notifications:
      * Implement a notification system to alert users or administrators about workflow failures.
      * This could involve sending emails, SMS messages, or integrating with a messaging platform like Slack.
10. Workflow Monitoring and Visualization:
      * Monitoring:
      * In engine.py, log detailed information about workflow executions, including:
      * Start and end times of workflows and individual actions.
      * Status of each execution (e.g., "running," "completed," "failed").
      * Any errors that occurred during execution.
      * Store execution data in the WorkflowExecution and ActionExecution models.
      * Visualization:
      * Dashboard: Create a dashboard in the frontend to display real-time and historical data on workflow executions.
      * Show the status of running workflows.
      * Provide a list of recent workflow executions with their status, start time, and end time.
      * Allow users to filter and sort workflow executions by various criteria (e.g., workflow name, status, date range).
      * Reporting: Generate reports on workflow execution metrics, such as:
      * Total number of workflow executions.
      * Average execution time of workflows.
      * Success/failure rates of workflows.
      * Number of times each action was executed.
      * Visualizations: Use charts and graphs to visualize workflow execution data (e.g., line charts to show execution trends over time, bar charts to compare success/failure rates).
      * Alerts: Integrate workflow monitoring with the alerting system to notify users or administrators of workflow failures or prolonged execution times.
      * Action-Level Performance:
      * Track the performance of individual actions within a workflow, including:
      * Execution time.
      * Success/failure rates.
      * Error messages (if any).
      * Store this data in the ActionExecution model.
      * Bottleneck Identification:
      * Analyze action-level performance data to identify bottlenecks in workflows.
      * For example, if a specific action is consistently taking a long time to execute, it might indicate a need for optimization or a problem with an external service.
      * Impact Measurement:
      * Track the overall impact of workflows on key metrics, such as:
      * Lead conversion rates.
      * Customer engagement.
      * Revenue.
      * This will help users understand the value of automation and identify areas for improvement.
      * Visualization:
      * Provide visualizations in the frontend to help users understand workflow performance. For example:
      * Use Gantt charts to visualize the execution timeline of workflows and individual actions.
      * Use bar charts or heatmaps to show the performance of different actions.
      * Allow users to drill down into specific workflow executions to see detailed performance data.
11. Workflow Collaboration:
      * Database Changes:
      * Add a new database table called WorkflowCollaborators with the following fields:
      * id (integer, primary key)
      * workflow_id (integer, foreign key referencing Workflow.id)
      * user_id (integer, foreign key referencing User.id)
      * role (string) - e.g., "viewer," "editor"
      * created_at (datetime)
      * API Changes:
      * Create API endpoints to:
      * Add collaborators to a workflow.
      * Remove collaborators from a workflow.
      * List collaborators for a workflow.
      * Update a collaborator's role.
      * Workflow Engine Changes:
      * When loading a workflow, check if the current user is the owner or a collaborator with sufficient permissions.
      * Prevent users from modifying workflows they don't have permission to edit.
      * Frontend Changes:
      * Add a section to the workflow details page to manage collaborators.
      * Allow workflow owners to add, remove, and update collaborators.
      * Real-time Collaboration (Optional):
      * For real-time collaboration, consider using websockets to allow multiple users to edit a workflow simultaneously.
      * Implement conflict resolution mechanisms to handle concurrent edits.
12. Workflow Templates:
      * Database Changes:
      * Add a is_template field (boolean) to the Workflow model.
      * Add a template_name field (string, nullable) to the Workflow model.
      * Add a template_description field (text, nullable) to the Workflow model.
      * API Changes:
      * Create API endpoints to:
      * List available workflow templates.
      * Create a new workflow from a template.
      * Create a new template from an existing workflow.
      * Update a template.
      * Delete a template.
      * Workflow Engine Changes:
      * When creating a workflow from a template, copy the triggers, actions, and conditions from the template to the new workflow.
      * Frontend Changes:
      * Add a section to the application to browse and search available workflow templates.
      * Allow users to preview a template before using it.
      * Provide a way to create a new workflow from a selected template.
      * Allow users to save an existing workflow as a template.
      * Distinguish between templates and regular workflows in the UI.
13. Workflow A/B Testing:
      * Database Changes:
      * Add a variant_name field (string, nullable) to the Workflow model to identify different variants of a workflow.
      * Add a is_control field (boolean) to the Workflow model to indicate whether a workflow is the control variant in an A/B test.
      * API Changes:
      * Create API endpoints to:
      * Create a new variant of a workflow for A/B testing.
      * Start an A/B test.
      * Stop an A/B test.
      * Get the results of an A/B test.
      * Workflow Engine Changes:
      * When a trigger fires for a workflow that is part of an A/B test, randomly assign the execution to one of the variants based on a predefined split ratio (e.g., 50/50).
      * Store the assigned variant ID in the WorkflowExecution model.
      * Frontend Changes:
      * Add a section to the workflow details page to create and manage A/B tests.
      * Allow users to define the split ratio for the test.
      * Display the results of the A/B test, including key metrics for each variant.
      * Analysis:
      * Compare the performance of different workflow variants based on key metrics (e.g., conversion rates, engagement rates).
      * Use statistical methods to determine if the observed differences in performance are statistically significant.
14. Workflow Optimization Suggestions:
      * Performance Analysis:
      * The workflow engine should automatically analyze workflow execution data to identify potential areas for optimization.
      * Redundancy Detection:
      * Detect redundant actions within a workflow. For example, if a lead's status is updated to the same value multiple times in a row, flag this as a potential redundancy.
      * Alternative Approaches:
      * Based on performance data and common workflow patterns, suggest alternative approaches to achieve the same goal more efficiently. For example:
      * "You can combine these two update_lead actions into a single action."
      * "Consider using a schedule trigger instead of a data_trigger for this type of workflow."
      * Visualization:
      * Visualize optimization suggestions in the frontend, potentially highlighting redundant actions or suggesting alternative paths in the workflow graph.
      * User Feedback:
      * Allow users to provide feedback on optimization suggestions (e.g., "helpful," "not helpful," "ignore"). Use this feedback to improve the suggestion engine.
Phase 3: Data Flow and Processing
Refined Prompt (to Blackboxai ROBOCODER AI):
"Define the data flow and processing mechanisms for the application.
1. Lead Capture Mechanisms:
      * Web Forms:
      * Create a forms/ directory to store form definitions (e.g., forms/signup.py, forms/contact.py).
      * Define Pydantic schemas for each form, specifying required fields and validation rules.
      * Create API endpoints to handle form submissions. These endpoints will:
      * Validate form data against the corresponding schema.
      * Create new leads in the database (using lead_service.create_lead).
      * Optionally trigger workflows based on form submissions.
      * Integrate forms with the frontend (e.g., using React components).
      * Landing Pages:
      * Create a system for building and managing landing pages (either within the application or by integrating with a third-party landing page builder).
      * Ensure that landing pages can embed web forms created in the previous step.
      * API Endpoints:
      * Create API endpoints (e.g., POST /api/leads) to allow external systems to create leads programmatically.
      * Implement appropriate authentication and authorization for API access.
2. Data Validation and Cleaning:
